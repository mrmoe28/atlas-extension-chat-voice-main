## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Extension Won't Load
❌ **Problem:** "Failed to load extension" error  
✅ **Solution:** 
- Make sure you **extracted the ZIP file first**
- Select the **extracted folder**, not the ZIP file  
- Enable **"Developer mode"** in `chrome://extensions/`
- Try refreshing the extensions page

### Microphone Issues  
❌ **Problem:** Voice not being detected  
✅ **Solution:**
- **Grant permission** when Chrome asks for microphone access
- Check `chrome://settings/content/microphone` - allow access for the extension
- **Test your mic** in other apps first
- Try opening a regular tab, grant permission there, then return to side panel

### Connection Problems
❌ **Problem:** Can't connect to server  
✅ **Solution:**
- **Default server:** Extension should work immediately with our hosted server
- **Custom server:** Make sure it's running on `http://localhost:8787`
- **Check your API key** in server/.env file  
- **Verify URL** in extension settings matches your server

### Desktop Commands Not Working
❌ **Problem:** "Open folder" etc. not working  
✅ **Solution:**
- **Enable "Desktop Commander mode"** in settings
- **Grant all permissions** when prompted  
- **macOS users:** May need to allow Chrome in System Preferences → Security & Privacy

## ❓ FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

### General Questions

**Q: Is Atlas Voice free to use?**
A: Yes! The extension is free and open-source (MIT License). You'll need your own OpenAI API key for the AI features, which operates on OpenAI's pay-as-you-go pricing.

**Q: What browsers are supported?**
A: Currently Chrome 88+ and Chromium-based browsers (Edge, Brave). Firefox and Safari support planned for future releases.

**Q: Does it work offline?**
A: No, an internet connection is required for AI features. The extension connects to OpenAI's Realtime API for voice processing.

**Q: Is my data private?**
A: Audio is streamed to OpenAI for processing. Text transcripts are optionally saved if memory is enabled. The extension collects no telemetry or tracking data.

### Setup & Installation

**Q: Do I need to set up a server?**
A: No! The extension comes pre-configured with our hosted server. You can optionally run your own server if preferred.

**Q: Where do I get an OpenAI API key?**
A: The hosted server provides credentials. If running your own server, get a key from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).

**Q: Why does it need so many permissions?**
A: Desktop automation requires broad permissions (file access, system control). You can review exactly what permissions are used in the [Documentation](./docs/FEATURES.md#extension-architecture).

### Usage Questions

**Q: Can I use it hands-free?**
A: Yes! Enable "Continuous Mode" for voice-activated conversation without holding a button. Wake word mode is planned for future releases.

**Q: What languages are supported?**
A: Currently English. Multi-language support is planned for v0.3.0+.

**Q: Can it control any application?**
A: It can launch applications, but in-app control depends on the application's accessibility. Browser-based apps work best.

**Q: How do I update the extension?**
A: The extension checks for updates automatically every 4 hours. You'll see a notification when a new version is available. Updates are manual (download and reload).

### Technical Questions

**Q: What's the voice latency?**
A: Typically <500ms via WebRTC direct connection to OpenAI's Realtime API.

**Q: Can I use my own AI model?**
A: Currently OpenAI only. Support for other providers (Anthropic Claude, local models) is on the roadmap.

**Q: Is the code open source?**
A: Yes! MIT License. View, modify, and contribute on [GitHub](https://github.com/yourusername/atlas-voice-extension).

**Q: Can I self-host everything?**
A: Yes! The server code is in `dev/server/`. Deploy to Vercel, your own server, or run locally. See [Advanced Setup](#️-advanced-setup-optional).

### Troubleshooting

**Q: Microphone not working?**
A: Check Chrome permissions at `chrome://settings/content/microphone` and grant access when prompted.

**Q: "Failed to connect" error?**
A: Verify internet connection and server URL in settings. Default is `https://atlas-extension-chat-voice.vercel.app`.

**Q: Desktop commands not executing?**
A: Ensure "Desktop Commander mode" is enabled in settings. macOS users may need to grant Accessibility permissions.

**Q: Can't see the extension icon?**
A: Click the puzzle piece icon in Chrome's toolbar and pin Atlas Voice Panel for easy access.
